Step 2. Exctract the zip file to an easily accessible location on your machine.



Step 3. launch winscp and kitty at the same time.

-on winscp put in their ip and port number 7868 and login like you would on kitty.



Step 4. Extract the zip file into the "/" directory in winscp. (if you are in the correct directory it will have a ton of folders like bin, boot, debootstrap, etc.)


Step 5. open the smokeping folder you just extracted and highlight all the contents in the folder and right click > properties > and give Owner R,W,X privelages. Do NOT touch the other privelages.


Step 6. Open kitty with the opie you had previously loaded and then type     cd /smokeping     then    ./smokeping.sh
This will install smokeping automatically. Refer to my issues tab to know what to keep an eye out for and how to fix it.
